# Eric Yoon's public CPSC 323 work

Students in Yale's CPSC 323 (Systems Programming) course are authorized to share test cases with each other. Here is a collection of my test cases for future students to use, along with class notes.

SEO tags for struggling students: Yale CPSC 323, Yale CS 323, Yale Systems Programming, TeX macro processor, heavy hitters, 323 bash, qemu

I took this course in 2024SP so assignment specs may have been updated
