# PSet 1

Hey everyone,

I've thought up a bunch of test/edge cases. I put them in a folder, and I included a script to run them.

Unzip the archive, put the directory somewhere near your code, and open the .sh file and edit the variables to your code paths. Then, run the .sh file (after chmod 777ing it) and see the output!

Hope this helps.
